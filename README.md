# SystemsToolkit

An all-in-one toolkit designed to aid in the handling of mundane data-entry and manipulation tasks revolving around a POS system.

Includes a GraphQL API used to serve FTP credentials for many POS systems, and a command-line front-end interface capable of adding/removing data from the API, as well as consuming API calls in order to mass-connect to any number of POS systems via FTP.
